# Odin-recipies
First project

This project was based around furthering my basic HTML skills and git skills during the foundation course of the Odin project. Through this project I have aquired a better grasp of using GIT effectively and to a high standard. Furthermore, by cementing my current knowledge of HTML I will become have become more fluent at using different elements efficiently. 

The basic website allows users to click on a link for a specifc recipe, this will then show the required recipe and instructions on how to make it.
